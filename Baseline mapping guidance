## 1. What is the MCSB?

**MCSB = Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark**

It is Microsoft’s reference framework for securing workloads in Azure.

Think of it as a **catalogue of security recommendations**, built from:
- Industry standards (CIS, NIST, PCI, etc.)
- Microsoft’s own best practices

Each control in the MCSB covers a key security area:
- Identity & access management
- Network security
- Data protection
- Logging & monitoring
- Governance

**Example controls:**
- Use MFA for all privileged accounts  
- Enable diagnostic logging  
- Restrict public access

## 2. What is the “baseline”?

The **baseline** is the default set of MCSB recommendations that **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** uses to evaluate your environment.

- When you connect an Azure subscription, Defender automatically measures resources against the **MCSB baseline controls**.  
- These appear as **Security Recommendations** and contribute to your **Secure Score**.  

**In short:**
- **MCSB** = the benchmark/framework itself  
- **Baseline** = the active implementation of MCSB checks in Defender for Cloud

## 3. How do ADO Security Scanner controls map to the MCSB?

**ADO Security Scanner** is focused specifically on **Azure DevOps** security:
- It scans pipelines, repositories, variable groups, service connections, etc.
- Its controls are **not part of the official MCSB baseline** (which is Azure-focused, not ADO).  

But conceptually, many of the scanner’s controls **align with MCSB themes**:
- **Identity & access management** → e.g. restrict broad group access, disable inherited permissions.  
- **Data protection** → e.g. don’t store secrets in plain text, use Key Vault integration.  
- **Governance & monitoring** → e.g. review inactive resources, enforce branch protection.  

**Example:**
- **ADO Security Scanner control**: *“Do not make variable groups with secrets accessible to all pipelines.”*  
- **MCSB equivalent theme**: *“Ensure secrets are stored securely and access-controlled.”*  

⚠️ There is **no official 1:1 mapping** between ADO Security Scanner controls and MCSB.  
However, you can align them manually by **category** (identity, secrets management, governance, monitoring).  


### 4. How do these controls align with security frameworks?

The ADO Security Scanner controls are not officially mapped to Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) or other frameworks.  
However, many controls **align conceptually** with widely used standards, such as:

- **MCSB** → Identity, Data Protection, Logging, and Governance domains  
- **CIS Controls v8** → Data Protection, Account Management, Secure Configuration  
- **NIST 800-53 / CSF** → Access Control (AC), Identification & Authentication (IA), Configuration Management (CM)  
- **ISO 27001** → Access Control, Cryptography, Operations Security  
- **OWASP SAMM / OWASP Top 10** → Secure build & deployment, authentication and authorization practices  

In short: while there’s no 1:1 official mapping, the scanner’s rules reinforce the same principles found in major cloud and security frameworks.

6. How can i verify what controls the scanner checks against and their total number?
Ensure you have the latest version of the ADO Security Scanner and run:
Get-ADO-Security-Scanner-Control-Details.ps1 (also in the repo)
